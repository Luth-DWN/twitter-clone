# Status

Hello, It has been a while since I last updated the twitter clone project. After some time, I decided to do a full rewrite of the project. You may ask **why** I did this. So, the project was getting too big and hard to maintain. Lastly, I've always wanted to dive into microservices and I wanted to see how it would work in practice.

Currently the update is still in early stages. The infrastructure i had it mind at the moment is as follows:

![twitter clone infrastructure](.github/assets/infrastructure.png)

Because I'm learning as I go, I don't want the infrastructure to be overly complex. Next, I'm not sure if I'll be able to deploy it in a production environment because I don't have much experience with microservices yet (and it's probably way out of my budget).

On a side note, I've been very busy with college and other real-life stuff. As a result, the project will most likely take some time to finish.

So, I hope you enjoy the project and I'll be back with updates soon. Thanks for reading!

(BTW, Suggestions are very welcome!)
